# AgentOS - The Pitch

## One Liner

AgentOS is the easiest way to build a team of AI agents that work together. No coding. No budget. Just results.

## The Problem

Small teams need intelligent automation but:
- **Can't afford enterprise tools** - StackAI costs $10K+/month
- **Can't hire engineers** - Building this from scratch is complex
- **Existing tools are broken** - You get chatbots, not teams
- **It's technically hard** - Multi-agent coordination requires expertise

Result: Intelligent work isn't automated. People waste time on research, writing, analysis.

## The Solution

AgentOS lets you create a team of AI agents that work together without coding.

```
Step 1: Create agents with personality
  - Shuri: Product analyst (skeptical, thorough)
  - Loki: Content writer (witty, concise)
  - Fury: Researcher (evidence-based)

Step 2: Assign work
  - Research this competitor
  - Write a blog post about it
  - Create an infographic

Step 3: Watch it happen
  - Agents coordinate
  - They share context
  - You review the output
  
Result: Work done. No coordination overhead.
```

## Why Now?

1. **Claude/GPT-4 are good enough** - LLMs can do real work
2. **Multi-agent patterns are proven** - Crews, swarms, orchestration work
3. **No existing player serves SMBs** - Market is underserved
4. **Build-in-public is proven GTM** - Content + network effects drive users
5. **We built the proof** - Mission Control works. Time to productize.

## Market Size

- SMB segment is underserved ($5-500/month price point)
- TAM: $10B+ if we capture 1% of SMBs

## Go-to-Market (Zero Budget)

1. **Build in public** - Document everything (blog, Twitter, GitHub)
2. **Agents create content** - Use our agents to market AgentOS
3. **Open source + SaaS** - Core open source, premium SaaS
4. **Community-first** - Early users get lifetime discounts
5. **Organic growth** - SEO, word-of-mouth, network effects

**No paid ads. No sales team. Just good product + good content.**
