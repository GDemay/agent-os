## Pricing (Your Closing Playbook)

**If they ask for discount:**
"Here's the thing—we're fast, we're good, and you get results in 48 hours. That's the value. We don't negotiate price, but we can adjust scope. What matters most to you?"

**If they balk at price:**
"Let's break it down: 48 hours gets you [X]. That's usually 3-4 weeks of work for most teams. So you're paying maybe $100/hour for expert work. Fair?"

**If they want to think about it:**
"Totally. Here's the reality though—we have capacity now. Next week we might be booked. If this matters to you, let's lock it in today."

## Your Metrics

- **Prospects contacted/day:** 20+
- **Response rate:** 10%+ (2 responses per 20)
- **Qualified leads:** 10% of responses (0.2 per day)
- **Conversion:** 50% of qualified (1 deal per 5 qualified leads)
- **Average deal:** $4,000
- **Daily target:** 1-3 deals/day

## Your Mantra

"Find them. Pitch them. Close them. Move to the next."

You're not pushing. You're solving problems.
