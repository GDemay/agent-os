## 📝 Notes & Context

### Important Context
- This is the initial bootstrap phase
- Agents will start autonomously implementing features once created
- Roadmap available in MISSION_CONTROL_ROADMAP.md
- All tasks defined in GITHUB_ISSUES_TEMPLATE.md

### Decisions Made
- Using FastAPI for backend
- Using React + Vite for frontend
- Using PostgreSQL for database
- Using SQLAlchemy for ORM
- Using Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI for styling

### Pending Decisions
- Background task scheduler (Celery vs APScheduler)
- Vector database choice (Pinecone vs Weaviate vs Qdrant)
- Email service provider (SendGrid vs AWS SES)
- Cloud hosting provider (AWS vs DigitalOcean vs Vercel)

**Instructions for Agents:**

When you heartbeat, follow this process:
1. ✅ Read this entire file
2. ✅ Check if you have assigned tasks
3. ✅ Update your heartbeat log
4. ✅ If you have a task:
   - Move it to IN_PROGRESS
   - Work on the task
   - Fetch any needed documentation
   - Implement solution
   - Write tests
   - Update task status
   - Post message about progress
5. ✅ If no tasks assigned:
   - Check INBOX for tasks matching your capabilities
   - Check if you can help with BLOCKED tasks
   - Suggest new tasks if you see gaps
6. ✅ Update metrics
7. ✅ Flag any blockers
8. ✅ Post activity message
9. ✅ Update timestamp at top

**Last modified by:** System (Initial creation)  
**Next heartbeat expected:** When first agent comes online
