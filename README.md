# AgentOS - AI Agents That Work

> The easiest way to build a team of AI agents that work together. No coding. No budget. Just results.

## What Is AgentOS?

AgentOS is a SaaS platform where you can spin up a team of coordinated AI agents without engineering. Think of it like hiring a remote team—except your team members are AI, they work 24/7, and they cost a fraction of a hire.

Each agent has a personality, memory, and assigned tasks. They collaborate, share context, and deliver results.

## The Problem We're Solving

- **Enterprise tools** (StackAI, Vellum) cost $10K+/month. Overkill for small teams.
- **Developer frameworks** (LangChain, CrewAI) require coding. Not for founders.
- **Chatbots** do one thing. You need a team that coordinates.
- **Small teams** want this but can't afford engineers to build it.

## What You Get

✅ **Agent Creation** - No-code interface to build agents with personality and skills
✅ **Task Automation** - Agents wake up, check for work, execute, report back
✅ **Persistent Memory** - Agents remember context across sessions
✅ **Collaboration** - Agents talk to each other, share findings, coordinate
✅ **Dashboard** - See what your agents are doing, real-time
✅ **Integrations** - Slack, Discord, Telegram, email, more (coming)

## Who Is This For?

- **Solo founders** - Need help with research, writing, analysis. Can't afford hires.
- **Small agencies** - Want to automate repetitive work without custom engineering.
- **Content teams** - Research, writing, editing, publishing coordination.
- **Early-stage startups** - Need intelligent automation on a bootstrapped budget.

## How It Works (Simple Example)

```
1. You create 2 agents:
   - Shuri (Product Analyst) - Researches competitors
   - Loki (Content Writer) - Writes blog posts

2. You create a task:
   - "Write a blog post comparing X and Y"
   
3. AgentOS does the rest:
   - Wakes Shuri → She researches competitors
   - Shuri posts findings
   - Wakes Loki → He reads Shuri's research
   - Loki writes the blog post
   - You review and publish
   
4. Result: Blog post done. No manual coordination needed.
```

## Philosophy

**Simple, not dumb.** AgentOS should feel like hiring competent team members, not configuring software.

**Eat your own dogfood.** We run the entire AgentOS business using AgentOS. Every task, every project, coordinated by our agents.

**Build in public.** We're sharing our journey on Twitter, blog, and GitHub. You'll see us build this in real-time.

**Zero budget wins.** We're proving you can launch a profitable SaaS with no paid marketing. Just content, community, and good product.
